\chapter{Introduction}

In the ever-evolving landscape of mathematical and statistical research and application, 
the integration of simulation techniques has emerged as a powerful tool to unravel complex phenomena, validate theoretical frameworks, 
and facilitate a deeper understanding of intricate mathematical structures. 
Simulation techniques are usually used when any problem  is heard to calculate with the help of traditional analytical method
like simulation of a Solitaire Card game, to analysis this traditionally we have to deal with the number like $52! = 8.06\times 10^{67}$ 
this number is beyond astronomically large so, dealing with this number is very hard even for a high performant computer, to deal with this problem
Polish-American mathematician and nuclear physicist Stanistaw Ulam with the help of Von Neumann develop Monte Carlo Simulation.
